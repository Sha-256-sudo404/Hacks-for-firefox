# Hacks-for-firefox
Assumption of these hacks: 
1. Sufficient RAM >= 8GB for efficient cache usage on ram to speedup, maximize ram usage and in turn reduce disk i/o
2. Tuning the rendering parameters for better consistency and responsiveness over reliance on slow disk cache

Benchmarks on my machine showed lowered latency (from 150ms to ~100ms) and improved consistency (s.d. 4.5% to 2.6%)

user.js opinionated for reduced latency and maximizing speedometer scores on firefox in linux

Thanks to betterfox and arkenfox for collection of ideas
